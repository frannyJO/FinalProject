The objective of this project is to utilize several components of the NEXYS 4 DDR board to emulate 
a version of the game whack-a-mole. This version of the game has two players, a player who serves 
as the controller of the “mole” and the other player who serves as the individual trying to whack 
the mole. The game is dependent on points, a score from each player is worth 100 points. Winning 
the game is dependent on which player reaches 1000 points first. More details regarding the 
specificities of the game will be discussed in the procedure section of this report.
